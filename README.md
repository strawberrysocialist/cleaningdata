Project for Getting and Cleaning Data
-------------

Note: The script assumes that the data from the UCI HCR was already downloaded and stored in a subdirectory of the current directory named "data".  

Steps to generate the data table  
-------------
1. Clone the repository  
2. Get the raw data using one of several alternatives  
  * Unzip the data.zip file into the current directory, or  
  * Edit the first line of the run_analysis.R script to change the value of the get.data variable from FALSE to TRUE.  Save the edited script file  
3. Run the script file, run_analysis.R, in R
